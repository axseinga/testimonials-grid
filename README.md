- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project (after some reading) I had a chance to test my knowledge about BEM methodology. I hope I get it right now. Elements in this challenge gave me a chance to use modifiers a lot. Also, it was a great opportunity to test my grid skills. As a small extra, I learned how to apply border as box-shadow to images.

```css
.border-shadow-for-image {
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 3px hsla(360, 100%, 100%, 0.3);
}
```
